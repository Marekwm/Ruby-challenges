Write a program that, given a word, computes the Scrabble score for that word.
You'll need the following tile scores:

Letter	Value
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T =>	1
D, G =>	2
B, C, M, P =>	3
F, H, V, W, Y	=> 4
K	=> 5
J, X =>	8
Q, Z =>	10
How to Score

Sum the values of all the tiles used in each word. For instance, 
lets consider the word CABBAGE which has the following letters and point values:

3 points for C
1 point for each A (there are two)
3 points for B (there are two)
2 points for G
1 point for E
total: 14

Understanding the problem 
If the input is an a falsy value or an empty string return 0
The standard input is a string and we will add the total of the character score based on the 
chart and then return it

Examples and test cases 
best off of the test cases we will need a Scrabble class with 2 methods
  the constructor method will take the argument and assign it to word
  
  the score method will iterate over each character of word 
  the characters evaluation is case insesitive 
  
datastructure 
the input is a string most likely or a falsy value (nil, or false)
the ouput is an integer 
the score chart is going to be captured by a hash 

algorithm
create a class named Scrabble with 2 methods 
  create the hash for the scores 
  
  the constructor method will be passed an argument 
    if the argument is falsy `word` will be assigned to an empty string 
    otherwise we will assign the string argument to `word`
    
  the score method
    assign the value of just the characters in uppercase to a variable called characters
    create a counter variable to keep score 
    iterate over each character of the characters
      then iterate over the score hash 
       find the what key the current character belongs to and at it's value to counter 
    
    return counter
