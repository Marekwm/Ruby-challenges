Write a program that takes a word and a list of possible anagrams and selects
the correct sublist that contains the anagrams of the word.

For example, given the word "listen" and a list of candidates like "enlists",
"google", "inlets", and "banana", the program should return a list containing "inlets".
Please read the test suite for the exact rules of anagrams.

Understanding the problem 
given a list of possible anagrams and a word 
select the words from the sublist that are anagrams of the first word that arent the first word and are unique
if no words are found return an empty array
case also does not matter but the same lowercases version of the word is still the same word 

Example and test cases 
based of of the test cases we need a class called Anagram that has 2 methods 
  the constructor method takes a string argument 
  
  the match method that take a collection of words and returns the anagrams 
  
Datastructure 
the inputs are a string and array 
the output is either an array of anagrams or empty array 

algorithm 
create the Anagram class with 2 methods 
the constructor method will take a string argument and assign it to an instance variable called word 

the match method will take an array argument that consists of words 
  create a local variable named anagrams and assign the array of selected anagrams to it
    the selection is done by making the words lowercase and sort them alphabetically 
    if these values are equal to `word` they are selected 
    
  then eleminate the non unique values 
  
return this array
