Problem
Write a program to determine whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
An equilateral triangle has all three sides the same length.
An isosceles triangle has exactly two sides of the same length.
A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths.
Note: For a shape to be a triangle at all, all sides must be of length > 0,
and the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.


Understanding the problem
Input: triangle object with 3 arguments representing each side
Output: the type of triangle or invalid triangle error 

explicit requirements:
Given 3 numbers as arguments to the constructor method to repseresent all 3 sides of a triangle
create an instance method that will validate the sides to either be a triangle or not 
then if it's valid evaluate if the sides make up 1 of the 3 triangle options 
a isosceles triangle 2 same 1 different side
a equilateral triangle has all same sides 
a scalene triangle has all different sides  

a triangle is not valid if one of the sides is less then or equal to 0 
the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side

Examples and testcases 
What classes do we need to make?
-We require a Triangle class

What does the constructor method look like?
-The constructor takes 3 arguments that repseresent the 3 sides of a triangle
an exception is raised in the constructor if any side length is <= 0.
an exception is raised if the side lengths taken together don't describe a valid triangle

what are the methods that we need(just their names and purpose)
We need a `kind` to determine what kind of triangle we have 

DataStructure
I will store the sides into an array 

Algorithm
Constructor 
-save the three sides into an array named @sides
-Check whether any side length is less than or equal to zero. If so, raise an exception.
-Check whether any sum of two sides is less then one side. If so, raise an exception
Both execptions should raise an ArgumentError 
==========================

kind - instance method  
---
-Compare the values representing the three side lengths
-If all three side lengths are equal return 'equilateral'.
-If the triangle is not equilateral, but any two side lengths are equal to one another, return 'isosceles'.
-If none of the side lengths are equal to one another, return 'scalene'.
