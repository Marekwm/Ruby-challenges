# practice problems
Pedac outline for the challenges 

Understanding the problem
explicit requirements 
implicit requirements
jot down any other information that allows you to better understand the problem 

Examples and testcases 
Further analyze the testcases and or make your own to see how everything should work 
What classes do we need to make
What does the constructor method(s) look like
what are the methods that we need(just their names and purpose)

DataStructure
Input data type and example 
Output data type and example based off of input 
Intermediate data structure: what kind of data structure do we need in between input and output

Algorithm
Constructor

Method 2

Code 
Remember to test early and test often 
If your algorithm is not consistant with the desired solution go back and fix it 
before continuing with code 
Dont rush the process and just be methodical
